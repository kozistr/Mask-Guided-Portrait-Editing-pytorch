# Mask-Guided-Portrait-Editing-pytorch
Unofficial Mask Guided Portrait Editing w/ cGAN implementation in pytorch.

Original Repo is [here!](https://github.com/cientgu/Mask_Guided_Portrait_Editing)

**WIP** / This implementation includes my version of tunings/tweaks :)

# Introduction
**Mask-Guided Portrait Editing** is a novel technology based on mask-guided conditional GANs, 
which can synthesize diverse, high-quality and controllable facial images from given masks. 
With the changeable input facial mask and source image, this method allows users to do high-level portrait editing.
